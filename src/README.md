# PostIt — Tiny sticky notes inside VS Code 🟨

Keep short reminders, snippets and to‑dos right inside your editor — fast, distraction‑free and private.

PostIt adds a compact status‑bar button that opens a small Post‑it panel beside the editor. It’s designed to be extremely lightweight and unobtrusive: perfect for quick notes that you want available while coding.

Features
- Quick access: click the status‑bar icon to open a small Post‑it panel.
- Create, edit, delete and reorder notes.
- Multiple colors to visually organize notes.
- Theme aware: adapts to light and dark themes.
- Local only: your notes never leave your machine.

Why use PostIt?
- Minimal and fast — no clutter, no cloud sync, no extra services.
- Great for short-lived reminders, copy‑paste snippets, or small checklists while you work.
- Saves time compared to opening external note apps or leaving your editor.

How to use
1. Click the PostIt button in the status bar (bottom right) to open the panel.
2. Add a new note, type your text, change color or delete it — changes are saved automatically.

Privacy
All notes are stored locally in your VS Code profile. Nothing is sent to external servers.
